First, try to use git push origin <branch-name> to push its own commitment.

If push failed, it is because the origin branch is ahead the local, you need to pull the latest version by git pull,

If pull failed, so fixed the conflict and commit at the local

After fixing the conflict, we could use git push origin <branch-name> to pull our commitments.

If git pull alert no tracking information, it is because that the connection between the local and the origin is not bulit, use code git branch --set-upstream-to <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>.
